This is currently a very, very simplistic app that implements the DrawGL library for android. It will hopefully evolve into something useful. Right now it changes the screen's color when touched via opengl. 

I wrote this from scratch in a day. It works as-is, but isn't very useful. The intention is to get back to this and make it into an app that does something.
